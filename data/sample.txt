Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing by enabling machines to understand and generate human-like text. 
They are built using transformer architectures that rely on attention mechanisms to process language efficiently.
LLMs are widely used for tasks such as text summarization, question answering, translation, and chatbots.
Despite their capabilities, LLMs can be expensive to run and may produce hallucinated or biased responses.
As a result, careful prompt design and evaluation are critical when deploying LLM-based systems in real-world applications.
