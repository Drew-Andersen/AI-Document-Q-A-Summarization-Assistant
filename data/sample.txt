Title: Introduction to Large Language Models and Modern NLP

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers 
and human language. NLP enables machines to read, understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both 
meaningful and useful.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a recent breakthrough in NLP. They are neural networks trained on massive datasets to process
and generate human-like text. Examples of LLMs include OpenAI’s GPT series, Google’s PaLM, and Meta’s LLaMA. LLMs rely on 
transformer architectures, which use **self-attention mechanisms** to efficiently model long-range dependencies in text.

Transformers have several key components:
- Attention Layers: Allow the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence.
- Feed-Forward Networks: Process the attended information.
- Positional Encoding: Adds information about token positions since transformers do not inherently process sequences in order.
- Layer Normalization: Stabilizes training.

LLMs can perform a wide range of NLP tasks:
- Text Summarization: Condensing long documents into short summaries while preserving key points.
- Question Answering (QA): Providing answers to questions based on context from a document or dataset.
- Translation: Translating text between languages.
- Sentiment Analysis: Detecting emotional tone in text (positive, negative, neutral).
- Text Classification: Categorizing text into predefined labels, e.g., spam detection.

Training LLMs involves:
- Pretraining on vast amounts of text to learn grammar, semantics, and factual knowledge.
- Fine-tuning on task-specific datasets for applications like QA or summarization.
- Using embeddings, which are dense vector representations of words, sentences, or documents, capturing semantic meaning.

Modern NLP workflows often combine extractive and generative approaches:
- Generative Models (e.g., GPT): Can generate new text, summarize, or answer open-ended questions. They are flexible but 
may hallucinate facts.
- Extractive Models (e.g., BERT, XLNet): Focus on grounding answers strictly in the input text. Deterministic and factual.

Embeddings are critical for modern NLP:
- Convert words, sentences, or documents into vectors in high-dimensional space.
- Enable similarity search, semantic retrieval, and clustering.
- Used in pipelines like document-based QA, where embeddings allow retrieval of relevant passages.

Prompt Engineering is essential when using LLMs:
- Carefully crafted prompts improve model output quality.
- Includes instructions, context, and examples to guide the model.
- Helps reduce hallucination and increases relevance to the task.

LangChain and similar frameworks allow developers to:
- Combine LLMs with structured pipelines.
- Split documents into chunks.
- Create chains for QA, summarization, and more.
- Integrate embeddings, retrieval, and custom logic.

Evaluation metrics for NLP and LLM outputs include:
- ROUGE and BLEU for summarization and translation.
- Exact Match (EM) and F1 Score for question answering.
- Human evaluation for fluency, coherence, and factual accuracy.

Challenges in LLM deployment:
- Hallucination: Model may generate plausible but incorrect information.
- Bias: Pretraining data may introduce social or cultural biases.
- Cost: Large models require significant computational resources.
- Security & Privacy: Handling sensitive data responsibly is critical.

In practice, AI engineers use a mix of:
- GPT for flexible generation and summarization.
- BERT or XLNet for extractive, fact-grounded QA or classification.
- LangChain or Hugging Face pipelines to orchestrate multi-step workflows.

By combining these tools, developers can build applications that:
- Summarize research papers or business reports.
- Answer questions strictly based on uploaded documents.
- Classify customer feedback, emails, or legal documents.
- Provide interactive AI-driven assistants with grounded knowledge.
